Brief: The Value Creation Framework (Perrini, 2006) helps companies and the
investment community to better understand how a more inclusive stakeholder-oriented
governance systems positively affects corporate performance. While firms values,
belief and activities have been already identified and classified into drivers, influencer
and influenced, variables specification their interaction mechanisms and rules have not
been evaluated yet.
A simplified NetLogo model has been built to frame and analyse company's policy and
related actions on people values and consequential corporate performances impacts.
Satisfaction has been chosen as the main variable including in calculation: salary,
mobility and training variation, training and satisfaction variation against average.
Key question: With which level of decreasing satisfaction a talented worker will leave
the enterprise?
