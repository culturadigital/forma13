Brief:
d(k) = ?1 (C1 + k) (N1 k)
b(k)= ?2 (C2 + k) (N2 k)
These two equations define probabilities for a certain node k in a network: the first is
the probability b(k) for the node k to delete one of its links, while the second is the
probability d(k) of the node to give birth to a new link. The higher the degree of the
node, the more likely it is that it will be chosen for the deletion or creation of a link.
The rest of the variables are defined by the observer with certain restrictions to keep
the network within certain limits. The proposal is to create a program similar to the one
in the NetLogo Model Library called "Preferential Attachment", where the probability
that a node will be connected to a newly created node is directly proportional to its
degree, but using the link variable.
Key question: How does a network evolve (in discrete time) using variable probability
for the creation and deletion of links?
