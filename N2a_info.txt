Brief: The goal of the case is to study and model the consumer behaviour when
choosing and buying different products of a specific market. The behaviour of good
companies are also modelled by applying dyanmic marketing actions when sales
change. These actions will try to maximize their sales in the competitive market of the
model.
Key question: What are the sales of our product in the market and how do our
marketing actions affect my sales?
